# REAL WORLD PROJCETS & PROGRAM DESIGN

BRIEF
1. Retrieve data from 2 spreadsheets, that represents the sales of a particular brand across multiple stores & key values for dates.
2. Autonomously find the data we are looking for. 
3. Write the data neatly, onto a new aesthetically pleasing spreadsheet.
4. Speed and ease of use are key.

PLANNED APPROACH
1. I intend to use python to solve this particular problem, mainly because it is both easy to read and its lists can themselves contain      other list which suits my personally chosen approach.
2. To read the downloaded file and write to a new spreadsheet i intend to use openpyxl, although i haven't yet discounted pandas and global.
3. Create variables for each sheet i intend to read.
4. Check that each sheet i am comparing has been formatted correctly.
5. Define several functions as to allow better functionality to my program. i.e. a function to check if the string of the row in the same    As the row above. allowing me to extract the information i am looking for compiling it into a smaller data set which should hopefully be    More efficient.
6. Compare the results of our search and functions
7. Use matplotlib to visualise the data.

EXTRA-MILE WORK
1. Create a GUI using tkinter reasons are.
a) Aesthetically pleasing and better user experience
b) Potentially superior functionality
2. Think of some sort of loop solution in which i can either extract the file from a default location, use a command line search to find      the file with the following if structure.
a) If any character in the string is not a character a number or a '.' print error message
b) Set a counter to count the number of times '.' appears if c = 2 print error message
c) If the filename typed ins strings last 5 or var{-5:] indices are '.xlsx' do nothing
d) If the filenames strings last 4 indices are '.csv' replace csv with xlsx
e) If counter is 0 append .xlsx to the string
    
LANGUAGES, LIBRARIES & MISC
the following are the key skills i believe i will need to be able to display:
  1. Languages: Python 3 & Bash (possibly jave script, html, if i can think of a useful application of both)
  2. Cloud & repos: Github
  3. Libraries: Tkinter, openpyxl, matplotlib
  4. Academic skills: Mathematical thinking, problem solving, understanding of Excel, directories.
  5. Computational understanding: dynamic programming, memory allocation.
